# slop-animator — project guide for Claude

A browser-based, low-framerate, monochrome ink-outline, **frame-by-frame bitmap animation** app.
Used heavily on **iPad with Apple Pencil** (iPad-first; mouse/desktop also supported). Svelte 5 +
TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind 4 + Vitest.

> This file is the handoff/index. The **detailed design rationale lives in `docs/superpowers/specs/`
> and `docs/superpowers/plans/`** (one spec+plan per feature, dated) — read the relevant ones before
> changing a subsystem. This file captures conventions, hard-won gotchas, current state, and the
> roadmap so you can pick up cold.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server (localhost, HTTP).
- `npm run dev:lan` — `HTTPS=1 vite --host` for iPad testing over LAN (Clipboard API + secure-context
  features need HTTPS; accept the self-signed cert once on the iPad). Note: corporate/guest Wi-Fi
  with client isolation can block iPad→Mac entirely — a tunnel (cloudflared/ngrok) is the fallback.
- `npm run build` — **`svelte-check && tsc --noEmit && vite build`**. The bar for every change is
  **0 errors, 0 warnings.**
- `npm test` — Vitest (node env, no DOM). Baseline ~**219 passing**. Canvas/DOM code isn't
  node-testable; only pure logic is unit-tested.
- `npm run lint` / `npm run format` — ESLint (incl. `eslint-plugin-svelte`, runes-aware) + Prettier.
- **Pre-commit hook** (husky + lint-staged) auto-runs `eslint --fix` + `prettier --write` on staged
  files — expect reformatting on commit; it's fine.

## Development workflow (IMPORTANT — this project uses the `superpowers` skills)

Non-trivial work follows: **brainstorming → write spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`) →
writing-plans (`docs/superpowers/plans/`) → subagent-driven-development (fresh subagent per task,
spec + code-quality review between) → finishing-a-development-branch.** Bug fixes use
**systematic-debugging** (find root cause before fixing — instrument/measure, don't guess).

- Branch off `main`; merge with `git merge --no-ff` only when the user says so. One commit per task.
- The user reviews/approves the spec before the plan, and the plan before implementation.
- After a feature, the design rationale is preserved in its spec/plan — link to them.
- Commit message trailer used here: `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`.

## Architecture map

- `src/anim/document.ts` — core model: `Project`, `DrawingLayer`/`ReferenceLayer` (`Layer`), `Cell`
  (`key`{canvas, optional transform/transformBox} | `hold`), `LayerGroup`, `RefTransform`,
  `transformBaseRect`, `cellTransform`/`resolvedKeyCell`, keyframe resolution.
- `src/anim/render.ts` — `compositeFrameLayers`/`renderFrame`; `drawTransformed` (refs),
  `drawCellComposed` (draw cells, composes `layer ∘ cell`); 2D path + WebGL **boil** path.
- `src/anim/onion.ts` — onion-skin ghosts. `src/core/boil-gl.ts` — WebGL line-boil.
- `src/core/brush.ts` (perfect-freehand "smooth"), `ink-brush.ts`, `stamp-brush.ts`
  (pencil/charcoal/airbrush), `pressure-curve.ts`, `ref-transform.ts` (gizmo math:
  `inverseTransformPoint`/`forwardTransformPoint`/`applyMove|Scale|Rotate`), `selection.ts`,
  `fill.ts`, `input.ts`, `cell-ink.ts` (per-cell ink/`contentBounds` caches).
- `src/state/appState.svelte.ts` — the global `$state` store (`state`), all mutation actions,
  history/undo, preferences gather/apply. **The single source of truth.**
- `src/lib/*.svelte` — UI: `Canvas`, `Toolbar`, `LayerList`, `Timeline`, `Playbar`, `AudioLane`,
  `RefTransformGizmo`, `BrushCursor`, dialogs.
- `src/persist/` — `project-file.ts` (zip: project.json + PNG per key cell; autosave + export),
  `preferences.ts` (localStorage), `autosave.ts` (IndexedDB, ~3s debounce).

## Gotchas (each cost real debugging — don't relearn them)

1. **Svelte `$state` import-alias rule.** All components are runes mode now (`svelte.config.js` sets
   `compilerOptions.runes: true`). A component that uses the **`$state` rune** CANNOT
   `import { state } from appState.svelte` — it trips `store_rune_conflict` (compiler can't tell the
   rune from `$`-subscribing a store named `state`). **Fix: `import { state as appState }`** and use
   `appState.`. `$effect`/`$derived`/`$props` do NOT collide (those files may keep `{ state }`).
2. **SortableJS layer reorder** (`LayerList.svelte`): SortableJS and Svelte both author the DOM. After
   a drop, read the new order from the DOM → update store → bump `dragNonce` wrapped by
   `{#key dragNonce}` for a full rebuild, **AND** `evt.item.remove()` the relocated node (a
   bottom-drop lands past the `{#each}` end-anchor so the keyed teardown misses it → duplicate row).
   Guard with a one-shot latch — SortableJS fires `onEnd` twice on cross-list drops.
3. **perfect-freehand `size` is a RADIUS basis**, not diameter: with `thinning:1` the rendered
   diameter is `2×size`. `brush.ts` passes `maxSize/2` so smooth strokes match the stamp/ink engines
   and the brush cursor. Don't "fix" it back.
4. **Transform compose model** (read `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-22-per-cell-transform-design.md`):
   transforms nest **`group ∘ layer ∘ cell`** at render. Forward render = `drawCellComposed`; the
   draw-through inverse must be `cell⁻¹(layer⁻¹(point))` (layer inverse first), and the gizmo pushes
   corners through `forwardTransformPoint`. **Units:** render/bake = DEVICE px (`×dpr`);
   gizmo/inverse/`contentBoxLogical` = LOGICAL. A stray dpr factor or wrong compose order = strokes
   land wrong (won't show in tests — verify in browser).
5. **`transformBox` is frozen on gizmo grab** (per cell/layer) to avoid the moving-pivot jump when you
   draw more on a transformed target.
6. Gizmo _drags_ don't push undo (only Apply/Reset do) — matches existing behavior, intentional.
7. Mouse strokes report no pressure (`hasPressure:false`) → drawn at constant nominal width
   (`sizeRange` collapses to 1); only pen pressure widens.

## Current state (all shipped & merged to `main`)

Frame-by-frame drawing (smooth/ink/pencil/charcoal/airbrush brushes, separate brush vs eraser
settings, pressure curve, eyedropper, brush/eraser size cursor), fill, selection/lasso transform,
layers + visual groups (collapse/visibility/drag-reorder), onion skins, WebGL line-boil, timeline
(keyframe/hold, scrub — perf-tuned), playback, audio Phase 1, MP4/WebM export (mediabunny),
reference layers (image/video, transform gizmo, metadata-only persistence + re-link), clipboard
image paste + rasterize-to-drawing-layer, **per-layer free transform** and **per-cell (current-frame)
transform** (Frame/Layer scope toggle on the Transform tool), autosave + global preferences. Whole
codebase is Svelte 5 **runes**; Prettier + ESLint + pre-commit hooks in place.

## Roadmap / deferred (wanted-later, not abandoned)

- **Transform Phase B — Group ("parent context") transform**: compose a transform ABOVE the layer for
  all layers in a group. `LayerGroup` is visual-only today (no transform field). The 4-scope model is
  in the per-cell spec. **This is the natural next transform feature.**
- **Transform later**: animated/keyframed transforms (per-cell is the stepping stone).
- **Audio Phase 2** (scrub, drag-offset clip, mute — fields exist in model/persistence) and **Phase 3**
  (mux audio into export). See `docs/.../2026-06-15-audio-track-phase1-design.md`.
- **Per-layer boil-strength UI slider** — data path complete (`DrawingLayer.boilStrength` honored +
  persisted), UI-only addition to the timeline layer row.
- **Onion-skin settings as a global preference** — extend `Preferences` + gather/applyPreferences.
- **Reference media auto-restore** — currently re-pick the file (no-bytes placeholders persist). True
  auto-restore needs File System Access (Chromium desktop) or a native wrapper; shelved.
- **Tiled + copy-on-write cell storage** — would cut RAM and enable an _expandable_ canvas (paint
  beyond the doc bounds for transformed layers); big cross-cutting change. See
  `memory`-derived notes / `future` discussion.
- **Tooltips on touch/pencil** — `title=` is mouse-only; needs a custom long-press (all touch) or
  pencil-hover (M2+ iPad only) tooltip. Not built.
- A `dev:tunnel` script (cloudflared/ngrok) for iPad-over-any-network — discussed, not added.

## Verification debt

Much canvas/DOM/touch/iPad code is build- + unit- + review-verified but **not browser-eyeballed**
(Vitest has no DOM). The transform features especially warrant an interactive `npm run dev` pass.
When you finish canvas/UI work, flag this to the user rather than claiming it's confirmed working.
